The functional decomposition method breaks down a conceptualization into smaller functions. Those functions then continue to break down, until they are just a series of library functions.

What the functional decompsition method fails to recognize is common patterns. The initial conceptualization stage may pave way to a particular set of functions. But from the initial conceptualization, it is possible that a utility function that could be used exists in two different functions. (too modular)

Functional decomposition also gives way to functions that are strongly coupled with the overall specific purpose, rather than other potential uses. (missing emergent properties)

Narrow focus, lack of integration, missing emergent properties, lack of abstraction.
