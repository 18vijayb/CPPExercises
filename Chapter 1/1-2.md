1. *a* has a value of 3. a starts out as 0. g(a) accepts a reference to a, and increments the value returning 1. f(1) simply returns 2. Because the reference to a was incremented by 1 by function g, *a* has a final value of 3.
2. *b* has a value of 2. b starts out as 0. f(b) accepts a copy of b and returns 1. g(1) accepts a reference to 1 (so it creates an anonymous object) and returns 2. Because the value of *b* was unchanged, *b* has a value of 2.
3. *c* has a value of 2. c starts out as 0. h(c) accepts a char reference of c. But because c is of type int, an anonymous object is created with a value of 0 within the function h, and 1 is returned. f(1) will return 2 since it is pass by value. Since the value of *c* was unchanged by h and f, *c* will have a value of 2.
